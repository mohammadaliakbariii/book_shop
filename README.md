To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately.

Create a virtualenv and activate it on Mac/Linux:

$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
Or on Windows cmd:

$ py -3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
That will create a new folder venv in your project directory. Next, install the project dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Now you can run the project with this command:

python manage.py runserver
